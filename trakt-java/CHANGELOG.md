Change Log
==========

1.3.0 *(2011-12-13)*
-------------------

 * Added list and activity service.
 * Movie and show services now have `checkin` and `cancelchecking` methods.
 * All "getter" methods have been deprecated and instead the instance
   properties should be used directly.
 * Transitioned methods which returned `MediaEntity` to use the more userful
   `ActivityInfo` type.


1.2.1 *(2011-09-15)*
--------------------

 * Add `dismissShow` and `dismissMovie` methods to the recommendations
   service.


1.2.0 *(2011-09-07)*
--------------------

 * Add `print()` method which acts like `fire()` except writes relevant info
   to stdout rather than calling the remote API. This can be very useful for
   debugging just what your application is sending.
 * Add `setUseSsl` toggle to `ServiceManager` and the individual services to
   control whether or not the SSL API endpoint is used.
 * Add `TraktException` which is thrown when an exception was returned from
   the trakt servers.
 * Add genre service for listing movie and television genres.
 * Add filtering methods to the recommendations service for start and end year
   as well as genre.


1.1.0 *(2011-07-17)*
--------------------

 * Fix deserialization of fields whose names contained underscores.
 * `getEpisodes()` in `TvShowSeason` is now a complex type that can hold both
   a count, an episode number list, or a list of episode object.
 * Add new properties to `Movie` and `TvShow`.
 * Some dates are now a `java.util.Calendar` where the precision is to the
   seconds. Ones that remain `java.util.Date` should only be used for the date
   they represent, not the time.
 * The search service is now available from `ServiceManager`.
 * New `enum`s for gender, rating type, and day of the week.
 * __Full test suite implemented__.


1.0.0 *(2011-07-01)*
